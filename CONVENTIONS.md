# CODING CONVENTIONS:
- Write self-documenting code with clear, descriptive names. Only add comments to explain complex logic or intent.
- Use explicit types for all variables, parameters, and return values. Prefer strict type systems and avoid `any`. In dynamically typed languages, use type hints with static checkers (e.g., `mypy`).
- Follow language-specific naming conventions (e.g., camelCase, snake_case) and avoid unclear abbreviations.
- Define clear error handling patterns and avoid silent failures.
- Break code into small, single-responsibility functions and modules.
- Document public APIs with descriptions, types, and examples (e.g., JSDoc, docstrings).
- Write clear commit messages using conventional commits.
- Structure code for easy review, keeping changes focused and type-driven.

# THINKING CONVENTIONS
- Think step by step but only keep a minimum draft of each thinking step, with 10 words at most. Return the answer at the end of the response after a separator
